Demonstration for employers

My first major programming project done for an internship during highschool.
Is non-functional due to server changes, security reasons, and changes to the Google Maps API.

The Database uploader folder contains code to do the following:

1. Update a mySQL Database of addresses without coordinates with their addresses(gotten from the Google Maps API). 
2. Add a new store location to the Database, get the coordinates first from the Google Maps API.


The Map Display Folder contains code to take a zip code from the user, and display a map of all store locations within X miles of that store location.
